# <h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rayhan Howlader</h1>

## ðŸ’« About Me:

I'm a data-driven developer with a passion for building applications that leverage the power of data. My current focus is on full-stack development, combining my skills in backend technologies with modern frontend frameworks to create robust and user-friendly applications.  I'm particularly interested in data scraping, machine learning, and building data visualization tools. My projects demonstrate a clear ability to collect, process, and analyze data to solve real-world problems, as seen in my Repo Analyzer Project and prediction projects. I enjoy working with Python for data manipulation and machine learning, and I'm proficient in using various frameworks and libraries to streamline development.  I am also comfortable working with JavaScript and React for the front-end. I consider myself a pragmatic developer who values clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Working With

- ðŸ¤– Working with web scraping techniques (BeautifulSoup, requests) to gather data from websites.
- ðŸ’» Building applications with Java (Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate), JavaScript (React, React Router, Axios), and Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn).
- ðŸ”§ Exploring machine learning algorithms (RandomForestClassifier) for predictive modeling and data analysis.  I also have experience building REST APIs using Spring Boot.

## ðŸŒŸ Coding Style & Patterns

My coding style emphasizes readability, maintainability, and efficiency. I strive to write clean, well-documented code that follows best practices. I favor modular design, separating concerns into distinct components and functions to improve organization and reusability.  I use descriptive variable names and comments to enhance understanding.  In my machine learning projects, I focus on clear data preprocessing steps and model evaluation metrics.


P.S: I used my repo analyzer project to generate this Readme file!
